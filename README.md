Planes VS Aliens is a game in which you control a spaceship to destroy incoming alien invaders. 
Gain boosts by killing lateral flying Ufos, gain points by killing alien ships, and score as many points as you can in combat.
This project is my first python project, and it is a big final assignment of the programming class. 
Thanks to team members Zhao Junhan and Li Chenwei for their contributions to this project, it is the efforts of the three of us that make this little game come into being. 
Although it is still very simple, I am still proud of it.

Planes VS Aliens是一款游戏，在游戏中你将操控一架宇宙飞船，消灭不断来袭的外星入侵者。通过消灭横向飞行的UFO来获取强化，通过消灭外星飞船来获得分数，在战斗中尽可能地取得分数。
这个项目是我的第一个python项目，它是程序设计课的期末大作业，感谢组员赵俊涵，李晨薇对这个项目的贡献，是我们三个人的努力才让这个小游戏诞生，虽然它还很简陋，但我仍为它感到骄傲。
